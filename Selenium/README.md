Selenium
==========

Thanks for taking an interest in ProQuest!

In order for you to become a test engineer here, first we need to measure you up and see how up to speed you are with the Selenium-Java WebDriver API.

## Instructions
Check out this repository from GitHub, and follow the steps provided inside of [ProQuestTest.java](https://github.com/pqdev/qa-proquest-interview/blob/master/Selenium/src/com/proquest/qa/interview/ProQuestTest.java)

The instructions within the test are clear on what you should be doing, but not **how** you should do them.  We leave this up to you.  However, for clarity, the test has a section at the top of the test
that contains instructions on what to do.  Follow the // TODO's, and Start making your compilable method at the `// TODO: Start here` mark.

**You will need Maven in order to fetch the selenium dependencies**

### Software

1. Java
